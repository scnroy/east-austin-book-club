Prize-winning author Solnit (A Field Guide to Getting Lost) delivers an
insightful glimpse into the compelling human interest stories behind five
major disasters: the San Fransisco earthquake of 1906, the Halifax explosion
of 1917, Mexico City's 1985 earthquake, 9/11, and Hurricane Katrina. But more
than just the stories, she turns her attention to the larger subject of the
sociology of disasters and the incredible community spirit that can arise amid
disaster. In contrast to media portrayals of negative human behavior in times
of distress, Solnit believes that humans have an intrinsic need to help each
other and work together in communities forged by disaster. These surreal
situations demonstrate how deeply most of us desire connection, participation,
altruism, and purposefulness. Thus the startling joy in disasters. Solnit
wonders if some of these ephemeral moments could be recaptured in our normal
day-to-day routines, thus enhancing our sense of community. VERDICT Despite
wandering into some murky what-ifs, this book offers a timely study in
community during these uncertain times.
