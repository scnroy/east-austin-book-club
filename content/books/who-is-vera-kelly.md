  New York City, 1962. Vera Kelly is struggling to make rent and blend into the
  underground gay scene in Greenwich Village. She's working night shifts at a
  radio station when her quick wits, sharp tongue, and technical skills get her
  noticed by a recruiter for the CIA. Next thing she knows she's in Argentina,
  tasked with wiretapping a congressman and infiltrating a group of student
  activists in Buenos Aires. As Vera becomes more and more enmeshed with the
  young radicals, the fragile local government begins to split at the seams.
  When a betrayal leaves her stranded in the wake of a coup, Vera learns the
  Cold War makes for strange and unexpected bedfellows, and she's forced to take
  extreme measures to save herself. An exhilarating page turner and perceptive
  coming-of-age story, Who Is Vera Kelly? is a novel that introduces an
  original, wry and whip-smart female spy for the twenty-first century.
