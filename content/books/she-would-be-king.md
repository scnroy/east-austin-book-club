Gbessa, exiled from the West African village of Lai, is starved, bitten by a
viper, and left for dead, but still she survives. June Dey, raised on a
plantation in Virginia, hides his unusual strength until a confrontation with
the overseer forces him to flee. Norman Aragon, child of a white British
colonizer and a Maroon slave from Jamaica, can fade from sight when the earth
calls him. When the three meet in the settlement of Monrovia, their gifts help
them salvage the tense relationship between the African American settlers and
the indigenous tribes, as a new nation forms around them. -- Adapted from
jacket.
