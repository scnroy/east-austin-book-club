In this radiant, highly anticipated debut, a cast of unforgettable women
battle for independence while a maelstrom of change threatens their Jamaican
village. Capturing the distinct rhythms of Jamaican life and dialect, Nicole
Dennis- Benn pens a tender hymn to a world hidden among pristine beaches and
the wide expanse of turquoise seas. At an opulent resort in Montego Bay,
Margot hustles to send her younger sister, Thandi, to school. Taught as a girl
to trade her sexuality for survival, Margot is ruthlessly determined to shield
Thandi from the same fate. When plans for a new hotel threaten their village,
Margot sees not only an opportunity for her own financial independence but
also perhaps a chance to admit a shocking secret: her forbidden love for
another woman. As they face the impending destruction of their community, each
woman--fighting to balance the burdens she shoulders with the freedom she
craves--must confront long-hidden scars. From a much-heralded new writer, Here
Comes the Sun offers a dramatic glimpse into a vibrant, passionate world most
outsiders see simply as paradise
