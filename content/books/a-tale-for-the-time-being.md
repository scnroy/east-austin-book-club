Meeting digitally in April, [contact us](/about) for the call-in information

In Tokyo, sixteen-year-old Nao has decided there’s only one escape from her
aching loneliness and her classmates’ bullying. But before she ends it all,
Nao first plans to document the life of her great grandmother, a Buddhist nun
who’s lived more than a century. A diary is Nao’s only solace—and will touch
lives in ways she can scarcely imagine. Across the Pacific, we meet Ruth, a
novelist living on a remote island who discovers a collection of artifacts
washed ashore in a Hello Kitty lunchbox—possibly debris from the devastating
2011 tsunami. As the mystery of its contents unfolds, Ruth is pulled into the
past, into Nao’s drama and her unknown fate, and forward into her own future.
