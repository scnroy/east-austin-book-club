  In 1985, Yale Tishman, the development director for an art gallery in Chicago,
  is about to pull off an amazing coup, bringing in an extraordinary collection
  of 1920s paintings as a gift to the gallery. Yet as his career begins to
  flourish, the carnage of the AIDS epidemic grows around him. One by one, his
  friends are dying and after his friend Nico’s funeral, the virus circles
  closer and closer to Yale himself. Soon the only person he has left is Fiona,
  Nico’s little sister.

  Thirty years later, Fiona is in Paris tracking down her estranged daughter who
  disappeared into a cult. While staying with an old friend, a famous
  photographer who documented the Chicago crisis, she finds herself finally
  grappling with the devastating ways AIDS affected her life and her
  relationship with her daughter. The two intertwining stories take us through
  the heartbreak of the eighties and the chaos of the modern world, as both Yale
  and Fiona struggle to find goodness in the midst of disaster.
