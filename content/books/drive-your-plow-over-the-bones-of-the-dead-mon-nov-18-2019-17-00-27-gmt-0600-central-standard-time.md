  A deeply satisfying thriller cum fairy tale, Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of
  the Dead is a provocative exploration of the murky borderland between sanity
  and madness, justice and tradition, and autonomy and fate. In a remote Polish
  village, Janina devotes the dark winter days to studying astrology,
  translating the poetry of William Blake, and taking care of the summer homes
  of wealthy Warsaw residents. Her reputation as a crank and a recluse is
  amplified by her not-so-secret preference for the company of animals over
  humans. Then a neighbor, Big Foot, turns up dead. Soon other bodies are
  discovered, in increasingly strange circumstances. As suspicions mount, Janina
  inserts herself into the investigation, certain that she knows whodunit.
