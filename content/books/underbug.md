Are we more like termites than we ever imagined? In Underbug, the
award-winning journalist Lisa Margonelli introduces us to the enigmatic
creatures that collectively outweigh human beings ten to one and consume $40
billion worth of valuable stuff annually. Over the course of a decade-long
obsession with one of nature's most influential but least understood bugs,
Margonelli pokes around termite mounds and high-tech research facilities,
closely watching biologists, roboticists, and geneticists. What begins as a
natural history of the termite becomes a personal exploration of the unnatural
future we're building, with darker observations on power, technology,
historical trauma, and the limits of human cognition. Her globe-trotting
journey veers into uncharted territory, from evolutionary theory to Edwardian
science literature to the military-industrial complex. Whether in Namibia or
Cambridge, Arizona or Australia, Margonelli turns up astounding facts and
raises provocative questions. Is a termite an individual or a unit of a
superorganism? Can we harness the termite's properties to change the world? If
we build termite-like swarming robots, will they inevitably destroy us? Is it
possible to think without having a mind? Underbug burrows into these questions
and many others--unearthing disquieting answers about the world's most
underrated insect and what it means to be human
