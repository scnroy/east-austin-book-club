  It’s 16-year-old Edie who finds their mother Marianne dangling in the living   room from an old jump rope, puddle of urine on the floor, barely alive. Upstairs, 14-year-old Mae had fallen into one of her trances, often a result
  of feeling too closely attuned to her mother’s dark moods. After Marianne is
  unwillingly admitted to a mental hospital, Edie and Mae are forced to move
  from their childhood home in Louisiana to New York to live with their
  estranged father, Dennis, a former civil rights activist and literary figure
  on the other side of success.

  The girls, grieving and homesick, are at first wary of their father’s   affection, but soon Mae and Edie’s close relationship begins to fall apart―Edie remains fiercely loyal to Marianne, convinced that Dennis is
  responsible for her mother’s downfall, while Mae, suffocated by her striking
  resemblances to her mother, feels pulled toward their father. The girls move
  in increasingly opposing and destructive directions as they struggle to cope
  with outsized pain, and as the history of Dennis and Marianne’s romantic past
  clicks into focus, the family fractures further.
