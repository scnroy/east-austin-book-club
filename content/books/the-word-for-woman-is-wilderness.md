Erin is 19. She's never really left England, but she has watched Bear Grylls
and wonders why it's always men who get to go on all the cool wilderness
adventures. So Erin sets off on a voyage into the Alaskan wilderness, a
one-woman challenge to the archetype of the rugged male explorer.


As Erin's journey takes her through the Arctic Circle, across the entire
breadth of the American continent and finally to a lonely cabin in the wilds
of Denali, she explores subjects as diverse as the moon landings, the Gaia
hypothesis, loneliness, nuclear war, shamanism and the pill.


Filled with a sense of wonder for the natural world and a fierce love for
preserving it, The Word for Woman is Wilderness is a funny, frank and tender
account of a young woman in uncharted territory.
