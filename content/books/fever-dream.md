questions: >-
  * Nina's mom has some really strong fears about her daughter - where do you
  think these fears are coming from and what are they?

  * Why is she uncomfortable around Carla? Why doesn't she want her in the
  house?

  * Why is the book so focused on details? Example, color of the bikini

  * Did the explanation of the worms and what happened resolve it for you?

  * So what are the worms? What happened to David? To Amanda?

  * How do you feel about the healer? What is she doing?

  * Does she effectively build tension? How?

  * Is David "new" or is his mom pretending because she feels she has failed at
  motherhood?

  * The Spanish title is "The Rescue Distance" - what does that change for you
  as far as your perception of the book?

  * Which details are vivid but the meaning uncertain?

  * What effect does this book have being mostly a dialogue?

  * Why is the boy the most knowledgable?

  * Carla knows the water is bad - she says it smells funny - why doesn't she do
  anything?

  * At the end it is just two fathers - what did you notice about that scene?

  * Argentina is one of the biggest genetically modified Soya producers - she
  doesn't name brands or companies - why?  What does not knowing who did it do
  for the story?

  * What is the effect of reading this vs learning facts about how many kids are
  harmed from the GM farming?

A young woman named Amanda lies dying in a rural hospital clinic. A boy named
David sits beside her. She's not his mother. He's not her child. Together,
they tell a haunting story of broken souls, toxins, and the power and
desperation of family. Fever Dream is a nightmare come to life, a ghost story
for the real world, a love story and a cautionary tale. One of the freshest
new voices to come out of the Spanish language and translated into English for
the first time, Samanta Schweblin creates an aura of strange psychological
menace and otherworldly reality in this absorbing, unsettling, taut novel.
