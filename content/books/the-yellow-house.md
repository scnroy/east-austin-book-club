  Sarah M. Broom's memoir,  The Yellow House tells a hundred years of her family
  and their relationship to home in a neglected area of one of America's most
  mythologized cities. This is the story of a mother's struggle against a
  house's entropy, and that of a prodigal daughter who left home only to reckon
  with the pull that home exerts, even after the Yellow House was wiped off the
  map after Hurricane Katrina.
