description: >-
  In 1982 in a southern city, David and Sarah, two freshmen at a highly
  competitive performing arts high school, thrive alongside their school peers
  in a rarified bubble, ambitiously devoting themselves to their studies--to
  music, to movement, to Shakespeare and, particularly, to classes taught by the
  magnetic acting teacher Mr. Kingsley. It is here in these halls that David and
  Sarah fall innocently and powerfully into first love. And also where, as this
  class of students rises through the ranks of high school, the outside world of
  family life and economic status, of academic pressure and the future, does not
  affect them--until it does--in a sudden spiral of events that brings a
  startling close to the first part of this novel.
