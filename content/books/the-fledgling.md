  Born on June 22, 1947, Octavia Butler was a groundbreaking writer in American
  letters. The first science fiction writer to ever receive the MacArthur
  Fellowship, Butler transcended the conventions of her chosen genre, exploring
  issues of empathy, social normativity, self-destruction, conservation, and
  tribalism. One of the few women of color publishing in a genre dominated by
  white men, Butler won the coveted Hugo Award and Nebula Prize twice each for
  her novella "Bloodchild," her short story "Speech Sounds," and her novel
  Parable of the Talents, respectively. 




  However, Butler's legacy moves beyond prizes alone. She has been cited as a
  godmother of Afrofuturism, and Hilton Als has identified Butler as the
  "dominant artistic force" throughout Beyonce's visual album Lemonade. 




  Butler's last work, Fledgling, reenvisions the vampire narrative. Her
  blood-drinkers, the Ina, develop a symbiotic relationship with humans. They
  are not frightening monstrosities. Like much of Butler's work, the novel takes
  up biological hybridity as a way to explore phenotypical or racial
  constructions.
