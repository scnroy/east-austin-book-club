description: >-
  Bodily waste is common to all and as natural as breathing. We prefer not to
  talk about it, but we shouldâ€•even those of us who take care of our business in
  pristine, sanitary conditions. Disease spread by bodily waste kills more
  people worldwide every year than any other single cause of death. Even in the
  United States, nearly two million people have no access to an indoor toilet,
  while the sewers of major cities worldwide are an infrastructure disaster
  waiting to happen. With razor-sharp wit and crusading urgency, mixing levity
  with gravity, Rose George's The Big Necessity breaks the silence, turning the
  taboo subject into a cause with the most serious of consequences.
