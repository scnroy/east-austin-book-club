  From 2014 to 2015, Mexican writer Luiselli (The Story of My Teeth) worked as a
  translator for the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services in New York, where
  she administered a 40-question survey to unaccompanied and undocumented minors
  who fled Central American the United States. She began this work during an
  unprecedented surge in the number of minors crossing the border. This
  book-length essay is a meditation on this crisis viewed through the lens of
  the survey questions, the most vital of which, "Why did you come to the United
  States?", often determines the outcome of the child's bid for citizenship: the
  more terrifying the circumstance, the better the chances. It is a
  distressingly Kafkaesque path to citizenship in which children are responsible
  for securing their own lawyers, and are often required to display physical
  injuries to prove themselves worthy of assistance. Luiselli explores the
  plights these children are fleeing-gang violence that can be traced to
  American anti-immigration policies, drug use, and arms trafficking-as well as
  their harrowing journeys, many riding atop Mexican freight trains (known as la
  Bestia, the Beast) to the border. In a coda, Luiselli highlights a student
  group at Hofstra University working to improve conditions for immigrants via
  educational and recreational programs. This is a vital document for
  understanding the crisis that immigrants to the U.S. are facing, and a call to
  action for those who find this situation
