description: >-
  The world as we know it is ending. Evolution has reversed itself, affecting
  every living creature on earth. Science cannot stop the world from running
  backwards, as woman after woman gives birth to infants that appear to be
  primitive species of humans. Twenty-six-year-old Cedar Hawk Songmaker, adopted
  daughter of a pair of big-hearted, open-minded Minneapolis liberals, is as
  disturbed and uncertain as the rest of America around her. But for Cedar, this
  change is profound and deeply personal. She is four months pregnant.
