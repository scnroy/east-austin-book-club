discussion_questions: "* What connections did you make between the books?\n* In Hook's
  opening, she says \"we can find the love our hearts long for, but not until we let
  go of grief about the love we lost long ago.\" How does that show up in \"The Trouble
  with Hating you?\" What is the characters relationship with grief? \n* What does
  Hooks mean by saying that the world is no longer open to love?  How does that show
  up in the novel? \n* What ways did the characters seek love even though they doubted
  it could be found? \n* Is love a transformative force in \"The Trouble with Hating
  you?\"\n* Hooks states that the romance novel remains the only domain in which women
  speak of love with any degree of authority and that the consumers of romance are
  largely women. What is your own relationship with romance novels? How did her critique
  influence how you might think of them in the future?\n* Hooks notes that few writers
  talk about the impact of patriarchy and how it stands in the ways of love - how
  did \"The Trouble with Hating you\" address patriarchy?\n* We don't often get to
  see the emotional side of men, how does Jay express emotions? What were you surprised
  to hear him say? \n* There is not a lot of sex in the novel - at least sex we get
  to read about, what was the author trying to say about intimacy? \n* Do these characters
  have a heart or soul connection (or neither?)\n* How did the scene with Mike in
  the novel make you feel? \n* What did you think of Jay giving her $1400 shoes? \n*
  How did the novel demonstrate what we bring into romances? What \"baggage\" did
  each character have?\n* What did you think of Jay confronting Mike? How else might
  Mike have been held accountable? \n* She mentions there are two choices after hearing
  about the bad company performance 1. work harder or 2 coast - what would you choose
  in her situation? \n* Why does the argument troupe exist in romance?\n* Liya does
  not want to get married, does the author set it up as a reasonable or abnormal decision?
