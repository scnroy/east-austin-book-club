  Schizophrenia is not a single unifying diagnosis, and Esmé Weijun Wang writes
  not just to her fellow members of the 'collected schizophrenias' but to those
  who wish to understand it as well. Opening with the journey toward her
  diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, Wang discusses the medical community's
  own disagreement about labels and procedures for diagnosing those with mental
  illness, and then follows an arc that examines the manifestations of
  schizophrenia in her life. In essays that range from using fashion to present
  as high-functioning to the depths of a rare form of psychosis, and from the
  failures of the higher education system and the dangers of
  institutionalization to the complexity of compounding factors such as PTSD and
  Lyme disease, Wang's analytical eye, honed as a former lab researcher at
  Stanford, allows her to balance research with personal narrative
