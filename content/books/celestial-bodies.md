In the village of al-Awafi in Oman, we encounter three sisters: Mayya, who
marries after a heartbreak; Asma, who marries from a sense of duty; and
Khawla, who chooses to refuse all offers and await a reunion with the man she
loves, who has emigrated to Canada.

These three women and their families, their losses and loves, unspool
beautifully against a backdrop of a rapidly changing Oman, a country evolving
from a traditional, slave-owning society into its complex present. Through the
sisters, we glimpse a society in all its degrees, from the very poorest of the
local slave families to those making money through the advent of new wealth.

The first novel originally written in Arabic to ever win the Man Booker
International Prize, and the first book by a female Omani author to be
translated into English, Celestial Bodies marks the arrival in the United
States of a major international writer.
