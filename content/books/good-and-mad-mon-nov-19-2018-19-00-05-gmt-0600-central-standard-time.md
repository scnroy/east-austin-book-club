  In the year 2018, it seems as if women’s anger has suddenly erupted into the
  public conversation. But long before Pantsuit Nation, before the Women’s
  March, and before the #MeToo movement, women’s anger was not only politically
  catalytic—but politically problematic. The story of female fury and its
  cultural significance demonstrates the long history of bitter resentment that
  has enshrouded women’s slow rise to political power in America, as well as the
  ways that anger is received when it comes from women as opposed to when it
  comes from men.
